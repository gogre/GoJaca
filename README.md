irgobot, inspired by the works of Yoshio Ishida and Michael Redmond, combines a revised version [1] of Swim Commonsense Go colour-map [2;3] with Influencie shadow map [4] and localised life-and-death analysis by Laizy [5], to compute and display board overlays which show Ishida-type graphics [6] of group strength, territory, influence and moyos.

An irgobot prototype is probably most readily programmed in a fork of Influencie embedded in a fork of Lizzie or Sabaki - or a mashup of both of them - with GTP callouts to Laizy.

Programming irgobot (or a part of it) - would be a practicable computer science project, or an ongoing AI hobby.
