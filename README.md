# irgobot
AI-enhanced Go client/editor/interface

irgobot, inspired by the works of Yoshio Ishida and Michael Redmond, combines a revised version [1a] of Swim Commonsense Go colour-map [1; 1b] with Influencie [2] shadow map and localised life-and-death analysis by Laizy [3], to compute and display board overlays which show Ishida-type graphics [4] of group strength, territory, influence and moyos. 

An irgobot prototype is probably most readily programmed in a fork of Influencie embedded in a fork of Lizzie or Sabaki - or a mashup of both of them - with GTP callouts to Laizy.

Programming and/or redesigning irgobot - or parts of it - would make a practical computer science student project, and/or an ongoing hobby for people interested in AI and Go.
