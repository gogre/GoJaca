irgobot, inspired by the works of Yoshio Ishida and Michael Redmond, combines an improved [1] colour-map [2] with Influencie shadow map [3] and localised life-and-death analysis by leela-zero [4], to compute and display board overlays which show Ishida-type graphics [5] of group strength, territory, influence and moyos.

An irgobot prototype is probably most readily programmed in a fork of Influencie embedded in a fork of Lizzie or Sabaki - or a mashup of both of them - with GTP callouts to Laizy.

Programming irgobot (or a part of it) would make a practical computer science project for someone interested in AI and visualisation.
