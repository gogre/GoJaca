# GoJaca
AI enhancement for Go clients/editors/players

GoJaca [0] combines a revised version [1a] of 'Commonsense Go' colour-map algorithm [1; 1b] with Influencie [2] and localised life-and-death analysis by Laizy [3] to compute and display board overlays which show Ishida-type graphics [4] of group strength, territory, influence and moyos. 

GoJaca's code is probably most easily constructed as a variant fork of Influencie, with callouts to Laizy.
Influencie is written in Java.

Programming GoJaca - or parts of it - might make an interesting AI student project, or an ongoing hobby for people interested in Go who are fluent in Java, or able to translate and augment Influencie's code in a language of their choice.
