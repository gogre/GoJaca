irgobot, inspired by the works of Yoshio Ishida and Michael Redmond, combines a debugged Swim colour-map [1]  with Influencie shadow map [2] and localised life-and-death analysis by leela-zero [3], to compute Ishida-type graphics [4] of group strength, territory, influence and moyos.

An irgobot prototype is probably most readily programmed in a fork of Influencie embedded in a fork of Lizzie or Sabaki with GTP callouts to leela-zero.

Programming irgobot (or a part of it) would make a practical computer science project for someone interested in AI and visualisation.
